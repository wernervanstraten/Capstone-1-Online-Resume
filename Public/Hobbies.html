            <strong>Web Development</strong>
            <p>I only started with Web Dev mid December 2024, and I have really enjoyed it thus far.</p>

            <strong>Gaming</strong>
            <p>I enjoy gaming in my free time. I mostly play online games since my friends have moved all over, and it's how we can still "hang out".</p>

            <strong>Handiwork</strong>
            <p>I enjoy being able to take an idea and bring it into reality; usually through woodwork, metalwork, or art. I think this is also why I enjoy and took to coding so quickly.</p>
